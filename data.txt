Enrolling more than 5,100 students, Bemidji State offers more than 80 undergraduate majors and eight graduate degrees encompassing arts, sciences and select professional programs.

NTC serves more than 1,000 students with an excellent education, an open-enrollment policy and affordable tuition. Students may pursue nearly 40 degree, diploma and certificate programs in six distinct career paths. Classes are offered on campus, online, or as a combination of both.

In this Northwoods setting, students, staff and faculty have a variety of activities at their fingertips. Possessing all the charm and character of a college town, Bemidji remains a tight-knit community of good neighbors and engaged citizens who always come out to cheer for the Bemidji State Beavers. While the city of Bemidji  named after the Ojibwe Chief Shaynowishkung (nicknamed Bemidji)  is home to a diverse population of more than 15,000 people, it serves a regional population of more than 100,000.


Located between three American Indian reservations  Leech Lake, Red Lake and White Earth, students at Bemidji State University and Northwest Technical College have the opportunity to experience a dynamic local culture and history. Bemidji also sits at the center of the legends of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. The famous statues of Paul and Babe greet students as they drive in from the south along Lake Bemidji.


Though quaint and historic, the city offers the urban conveniences upon which college students rely. Bemidji State and Northwest Tech are both conveniently located minutes away from affordable restaurants, cozy coffee shops, grocery stores, city parks and more. Small, locally owned shops and art sculptures line the streets of downtown Bemidji, while national chains can be found in and around the Bemidji area, including an uptown selection of department stores and restaurants.


The thriving downtown community presents ample opportunities for engagement off-campus. Among other things, there are fine-dining restaurants, cafes, and a natural foods co-op in downtown Bemidji. The historic Paul Bunyan Playhouse has a calendar of classic shows; restaurants and lounges offer weekly live music performances; the First Friday Art Walk provides a tour of new monthly art exhibits; and annual events such as the Loop the Lake Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, the Blue Ox Marathon, Bemidji Winterfest, and The Minnesota Finlandia bring the community together.


For those who love the outdoors, there are wooded, multi-use trail systems within minutes of campus and community parks with walking trails, playgrounds and a skate park. Lake Bemidji State Park and its miles of navigable trails is located directly across the lake from BSU, and the Buena Vista Ski Area  just 12 miles north of campus  offers downhill skiing and campus-sponsored student transportation in the winter months. Further, the Mississippi River Headwaters is a mere 45 minutes from Bemidji.

What the team looks like
You'll be joining a community of 30+ engineers, grouped into sub teams with specific domain focus. The team is made up of hardworking people from all over the world. We work from London, San Francisco, Boston, Colorado and New York, and as well as collaborate with folks remote across the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds.
We represent a wide range of experience and interests, and we all agree to do three things well:
We strive to build a strong team that allows us to do and learn more than we could as individuals. Being inclusive is a part of our team's culture and community.

Who You Are
First off, you dont need a Computer Science degree to apply. We encourage people from both CS and non-CS backgrounds with equivalent work experience to apply.
You are an engineer with 2+ years experience in industry.

Work closely with teams across product engineering, product management and design to build features that affect millions of users daily.
This job is more than JavaScript. Your non-coding skills (Communication, Mentoring, Project Management, etc) are very important.

What is Silverfin

First of all, we build a hell of a product and our customers love us. Even our customers customers love us. Silverfin solves a very real problem: it automates a large chunk of the repetitive tasks that people working in financial services spend their time on and improves communication with their customers.


What about our team?

Next to the bigger development team we have working on the main app, we have a fairly new team that works on bootstrapping third-party integrations, building advanced migrations tools, and helping customers and third-party developers with our API. This new team currently has a couple of junior Ruby developers eager to learn from an experienced colleague.

TurnCommerce is looking for an exceptional C# / .Net developer to help launch several new exciting platforms! If you've been programming .net for less than 3 years you are probably not the ideal candidate. This programmer should be Internet savvy as the primary role for this position will be to build many advanced programs in .Net from scratch.

We prefer finding people who have experience with front-end applications that deal with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. But given we have multiple positions open, we do not require you to be a frontend developer.

Location

The candidate should live in the greater Denver metropolitan area.

Requirements

We are looking for a .Net developer with experience working with the following:

Backend Programs - You should have the ability to be able to program backend programs that run in the background and does not interface with front-end applications.
Data Manipulation - A large amount of things the .Net programmer will be doing is data manipulation. Small, but important such things might be how to properly capitalize "ThiS WOrd". Or another example would be taking the text from a Web page and stripping it of HTML. Another example is taking a plain text file, and sorting it by the keyword density (most commonly found words on that page.)
Java Script / CSS - You should have a very good understanding of HTML, Java Script and CSS - being able to do this on many different projects we work on.
API Experience - Many of our programs "piggyback" off of existing programs and technologies. You will need to be familiar with accessing external data sources (Databases, Web Services, Program APIs) and be able to leverage other technologies for faster and more stable development.
SQL Statements / MySQL - We do heavy work with the MySQL database. You should have knowledge of how to SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT from a SQL Database using .Net - so you can access and manipulate data from within .Net itself. Advanced database work will be critical to long term success.
Beneficial additional skills

The following are not absolutely required, but we do expect candidate to know some of the following:
Multi-Threaded Applications - Multi threaded applications that help applications be fast and stable.
Internet Technologies - You should have a very good understanding of underlying net technologies such as Email, DNS, FTP, Encryption, SSL, etc.
Socketed Connections - Working with socketed connections both for outbound communications, but also to listen to inbound communications as well.
Logical Thinking / Problem Solving - A very good ability to look at complex tasks and break them down to the logical framework that will allow the task to be completed successfully.
Ideal candidate

We are looking for a self-starter who is capable of building very advanced C# applications on his/her own.

Pay and compensation

The short answer to this question - it all depends. Our pay scale ranges for this position depending on your skills and qualifications.

Apply

TurnCommerce is pre-screening all applicants based on your previous work experience and will not consider candidates who have not completed the online application. After you have submitted the application, we will look over your answers and contact you if we feel there is a potential match.

TurnCommerce is located in downtown Denver, Colorado. The business was incorporated in August of 2003 and experienced rapid growth since it was created. TurnCommerce maintains and operates some of the largest domain name properties in the world.

A few benefits
We pay you to quit
If for any reason you don't absolutely love your job at TurnCommerce, the company will pay you $2,000 to quit/resign within the first 6 months of employment. Life is short. If for any reason you don't feel TurnCommerce is the perfect fit we will pay you to leave the company (credit goes to Zappos for originally coming up with this perk.)

State of the art gear
You tell us what hardware you like to roll with and we will make it happen! Most people in the company use 4 monitors. Some even more. Our development rigs are extremely fast. You get the point. We believe three monitors in a development environment is the minimum but you can request as many as you like.

Very few meetings
Don't like meetings? Great. We hardly have any planned or structured meetings. Why? Because we would rather be hard at work solving important technical problems. When we need to discuss project requirements or a new technical implementation, we gather in an informal setting and just start working towards the solution to that particular problem.

Commitment to learning
TurnCommerce is committed to development and the enrichment of all employees and has a process which facilitates ongoing learning opportunities.

Job Description Summary

Job Description

The TURBO (Transforming and Unifying Research with Biomedical Ontologies) group seeks a software developer/engineer to join our team of ontologists and programmers to help create a novel suite of graph database applications. Ontologies and graph databases are part of an exciting new movement in information technology that elevates data to the level of knowledge. The technologies in this space are just beginning to gather steam. As a result, there is significant opportunity to make an impact in what will likely become a popular field in informatics. The base server side technology for ontologies and graph databases is Java, so we will likely write tool sets and applications in Java and JVM languages like Groovy and Scala. Automated testing will be a key component of all code produced by TURBO. We are developing tools that will assist ontologists in transforming discrete data to ontologized forms with assured correctness (see https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S2590-177X (20)30021-4). We are working with the Penn Health system to provide graph-based tools for searching clinical data by researchers in efficient and adaptive ways. We work on open-source projects ( https://github.com/PennTURBO ) to provide innovative tools for the biomedical research community.

This position offers the opportunity to interact with leading medical investigators, ontology experts, and skilled programmers in a university and health system setting. TURBO programmers are encouraged to take advantage of the University tuition reimbursement program and pursue an advanced degree while contributing to an active and evolving area of technology.

Position is contingent upon funding.

Qualifications:
Bachelor's degree in computer information science, software engineering, or a related field of study required and a minimum of 1 to 3 years of software development experience preferred or an equivalent combination of education and experience.
